title: Lift Switch
description: "The Lift Switch is a device that modifies the output from an assistive
  switch. This  can enable a user who would prefer to rest on their switch and
  lift off of it to activate it, instead of requiring the user to hover over the
  switch. There are four operating modes: momentary, latching, timed latch, and
  reverse acting. The Lift Switch adapter can be used with a switch-adapted
  device or as a switch interface for a computer."
intended-use: This hardware is intended for use by people with disabilities to expand
  functionality or enable functionality of an assistive switch.
